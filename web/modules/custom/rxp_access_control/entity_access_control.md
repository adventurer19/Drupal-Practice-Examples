One of Drupal's more powerful features is the fine-grained ability to
control permissions and control access to content. The entity api helps enable this
functionality by providing an interface to help define access control.
In this tutorial we'll 
Look at how access control is handled using, Drupal core as an example.
Demonstrate how to implement access control in a custom module.
Learn about the hooks that allow developers to modify access control for entities provided by another module.

By the end of this tutorial you should have a better understanding of the entity access control
system and how to work with it.

Goal
Understand how to implement or alter access control for entities.
If you're already familiar with entity API Implementation basics
you know that the behavior of each entity is defined by an @EntityType annotation.
These annotations also specify how access control works for the particular entity type.
Let's take a look at an example from Drupal core for the entities created by thew
menu system.

Menu links are a content entity created by the menu_link_content module
We can find the entity type definition for the menu links in the class
within /core/modules/menu_link_content/src/Entity/MenuLinkContent.php
In particular,(конкретно,специфично) let's look at the 
@ContentEntityType annotation from this file.
Notice among the handlers defined within this annotation that we're mapping a particular
class to an access handler.
This class will be responsible for providing the access control checks for any 
entity of this type.
handlers = {
*     "storage" = "Drupal\Core\Entity\Sql\SqlContentEntityStorage",
*     "storage_schema" = "Drupal\menu_link_content\MenuLinkContentStorageSchema",
*     "access" = "Drupal\menu_link_content\MenuLinkContentAccessControlHandler"
}

Next let's take a look at the file that provides this acces control handler class in the 
This class extends the EntityAccessControlHandler which provides the default
implementation for entity access control.The EntityAccessControlHandler class is also used if no access handler 
is specified in the ContentEntityType annotation.
The EntityAccessControlHandler class is also used if no access handler is specied in the contententitytype annotation.

The access control for the menu links is a bit simnpler that other content entities.
Since they're not directly viewed.the access control we're concerned about in  this class
has to do with the create , update and delete operation.
the checkAccess() method does most of this work for us.

Here we can see the code responsible for perming access checks for the view,
update and delete operations.  For updates there is a check to see if the account
has the 'administer menu' permission. If it does not, AccessResult::neutral is returned with an 
additional message about the missing permission.
This may be a bit confusing, so let's step back and see what the possible return values are 
There are three different possible return values for an access check
- Allowed (explicit final say)
- forbidden(explicit final say)
- neutral

Generally speaking, providing a return value of either allowed or forbidden gives your code
the final say on the access permissions of this entity. Returing a result of neutral allows other modules 
to interact with this access query before a definive 
answer is maked. This is a common patter in Drupal core, but as we'lll see later less common when working with a 
custom entity.
On the other hand, if the account does have the 'administer menu' permisson 
we explicitly reurn an AccessResult::allowed(). object
Notice that as this object is constructed we're also calling a pair of helpers
methods to add cacheability metadata about the permissions and granularity of this 
access control. This helps speed up access control checking so we don't have to execute this code any more often that
is required.

When it is time to actually render our menu link entities access can be determined by calling 
the access() method directly on the entity
$entity->access($operation). In this case the acces method that is called is EntityAccessControlHandler::access 
which is reproduced in the part below.

From the code  documentation within this method we can see that by returnbing 
accessresult::neutral we will be implicitly denyinng acces since our access control depends on a module explicitly returning an allowed or forbidden result.

This code also gives us a clue as how we can modify the access control results for enitites defined by other modules.

Modifiyng access control
Looking at the code in EntityAccessControl handler::acces there are two calls to
$this->moduleHandler()->invokeAll()
This is how Drupal invokes particular hooks that allow modules to alter the behavior 
of each other. In this case this access metohd is invoking two hooks back to back and merging the results
The first hook that is called is hook_entity_access. This hook is passed an entity along with
the operation and account objects in order to allow custom modules to affect the accces control of any entity.

The second hook that is invoked in this access() method provides a bit more 
granularity and allows you to target a particular entity type.
This hook uses the dynamic entity type id to construct the access hook name.

hook_ENTITY_TYPE_access. Using this hook is prefered whenever possible,since it
allows you to encapsulate the access control operations for a particular entity type
within a single hook. These hooks both provide a (relatively) lightweight way
of affecting the access control of entities defined by other modules without having to 
go to the trouble of fundamentally changing the way their access control works.


Access control in custom entities

Let's look at how to go about implementing access control with a custom entity.
For this example we're going to use a Contact entity provided by a contributed module
withing the Examples project. You can grab the completed example code here. This content_entity_example module
provides a Contact entity. The @ContentEntityType annotation for this entity can be found in
,after you install the Examples module. This annotation defines an access handler class
ContactAccessControlHandler as shown below.

Since this is the class that actually implements the access control for out Contact entites, let's look at in a bit more 
detail
 
Compared to the access control we look at with menu links this implementation is
relatively straightforward. The checkAccess() method is looking for a particular
permission for each type of operation that can be performed on this entity
view ,edit delete, The AccessResult object that is returned uses the allowedIfHasPermission() method 
to do a comparision between the account
object being passed in and a string that represents a particular permission. In this case , the 
permission is also defined by the content_entity_example module
but you could use any existing permission in you implementation.
As an aside, if you rely on an exisitng permission from another module it would  be a good 
idea to add this module as dependency in the info file for your custom module
Since the create operation doesn't already have an exisitng entity, there is also a second method
checkCreateAccess() to do a similar permission check for that operation.


Recap
In this tutorial ,we saw how the Entity Api implements access control
through a couple of examples.We looked at how Drupal core implements accces control 
for the menu link entities, and how the 3 types of AccessResult values work.We then control of other entities types.
Finally, we took a look at howe could implement access control for our own custom entity type.

Further your understanding
- There is one implementation of hook_entity_access() in Drupal core(not couting tests)
Can you find it ?What kind of access control is setting up ?
There is one implementation of hook_ENTITY_TYPE_access in drupal core
- While AccessResult::allowedIfHasPermission is useful way to check for a particular permission,how might you go about
checking for multiple permissions before deciding on a particular AccessResult ?
