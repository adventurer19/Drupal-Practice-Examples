# In this tutorial we'll look at different ways of adding access control to a route including:

1. Access based on the current user's roles and permissions
2. Access based on custom logic in a callback method
3. Logic in an access checker service


This approach is good if you access logic is only ever going to apply 
to this route.It's a little simpler, and keeps the code all in one place.

# Add _custom_access configuration for the route

First, you need to add a requirements._custom_access entry that points to a 
callback that is responsible for determining access.
The value of _custom_access should be the name of a method on the same class as 
the primary _controller that will perform the access checking. 
The method should return an instance of \Drupal\Core\Access\AccessResultInterface.
In our example, we make the minimum username length configurable by having the access
method to take an argument, and then using a static route parameter to set a value
for that argument via the min_username_length option,

# Define the access callback method
Next, define the method you just configured above.
Theis will be a method on the same class as the build()
method that returns content for the route.
The one requirements is that the specified method must return 
an instance of AccessResultInterface.
Here's an example of src/Controller/ExampleController.php

In the example above , the $account argument from the access method will be
automatically populated by the controller resolver, which is the code responsible
for calling the controller. And the $mind_username_length argument will be populated with the value from the route
options.min_username_length configuration in the routing YAML file.

The _custom_access method can have arguments passed to it, similar to how the default _controller method
does.The following optional arguments will be populated if they are properply type hinted.

- The slugs, upcasting for which is perfomed as accordance with the 
 parameters on the route's controller, not the access checker.
- \Symfony\Component\Routing\Route $route
- \Drupal\Core\Routing\RouteMatch $route_match 
- \Drupal\Core\Session\AccountProxy $account

# Custom access via an access checker as service

If your access controller logic will be used in other places,
and isn't just one-off logic for the specific controller, you should implemen t a custom access 
checker service.For example, if you wanted to use the same logic to limit access to multiple
different routes. Or if you'll need to use the same logic to check access for a route and whetever to display a custom 
block.
We'll reuse the example from above, and refactor it to  be an access checker service instead

Create the service class

Create a new class to contain the logic fro your access checker 
service. The cfile containing the class should be located in your 
modules' src/Access directory

Example /src/Access/MinUserNameLengthAccessChecker.php
The logic is the same as the previous example.
And the resolution of arguments for the access method works the same way.

Add an entry to the module's services YAML
You'll need to tell drupal about your new access checker services by adding an 
entry to the module.services.yml file for your module,.

Set the name service tags value to access_check so that Drupal knows this is an access
checker service and that it'll implement AccessInterface. And use the applied_to tag to give you
services a unique name, which will be used later in the route definition(under Requirements).
This should be prefixed with an underscore (_).

Use the new access checker service in a route definiton

Finally, we need to use the newly created access checker service in a route definition.
Do this by adding the value of the applied_to service tag we set the above 
nested under requirements.
requirements:
Name of the access checker service to use to check access for this route.
Defined by the applied_to service tag 
_min_username_length: 'TRUE'

Access to the route will now be checked using the new service.
And, code elsewhere in your site can make use of the service via the service container like
\Drupal::service('{service_name}') to perform acceess checking

If you need to make use of other services in your access checker other than those that 
are made available by type hinti ng, you can use standart dependency 
injection. For example , if you needed the http_client services to perform your access checking logic you would:
- update your service definition in the module.services.yml file to include an arguments like
arguments: [@http_client]
- Add a constructor to your class that accepts the injected services.
  public function __construct(\GuzzleHttp\Client $client) {
  $this->client = $client;
  }

Multiple access control requirements

In the case where you've specified more than one access control requirements
for example _role and _custom_access,the andIf operation will be used to combite 
the results. All methos must return a result of AccessResult::allowed()
or access will be denied.

Recap
In this tutorial we learned how to add access control to a route using a variety 
of different approaches including permissions, role and custom logic.
As well as discussed the use case, and advantages of each approach.
We learned that adding access control to a route starts with configuration in the routing.yml file
and in some cases , also requires writing php code to perform custom logic.

Further your understanding.
Could you refactor the above custom access control logic so that your module defined a new permission,
and access the route was based on that permission?Why yould you choose that approach ?
Why is access control for routes with entities unique?
